# iTravel

Do you ever wish that you could have an app where you can keep track of all your travel plans? iTravel will turn that into a reality. My fiance and I are in the process of planning our honeymoon and I realized that there wasn't an app that would allow me to create a list of places that we could stop by and visit, and that is how I came up with the idea of iTravel.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open VS code
2. Run the app using a iOS emulator
3. If the app doesn't open look for the airplane icon in the home screen

Instructions for using the software:

1. Type your desired destination for your trip
2. If desired, include a brief note to describe what the trip is about
3. After you have entered your desired information, tap the "Add Trip" button
4. Made a mistake or a typo when adding a trip? No worries! Just tap the trash icon and it will get rid of the card
5. Do you want to see all the trips you have added? Tap on the heart to go to your favorites page where you will find all your saved trips

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code capable of running a mobile emulator
* Flutter needs to be installed

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Setup and Test Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/quick)
* [Build iOS and Android apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaZnf4p6itA)
* [Your First Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make the trips more descriptive (include dates)
* [ ] Have multiple images instead of just one preset one
* [ ] Be able to create groups of destinations in one trip instead of being limited to just one
